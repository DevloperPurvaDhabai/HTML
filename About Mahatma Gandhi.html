    <p><h3><u><u><i>Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</i></u></u></h3></p>
    <p>Gandhi grew up in a home steeped in religion, and he took for granted religious tolerance and the doctrine of
        ahimsa<br/> (noninjury to all living beings).He studied law in England from 1888 to 1891, and in <b>1893</b>
        he took
        a job
        with an<br/> Indian firm in South Africa. There he became an effective advocate for Indian rights.In
        <b>1906</b> he
        first
        put into<br/> action satyagraha, his technique of nonviolent resistance. His success in South Africa gave him
        an
        international reputation, and in<br/> <b>1915</b> he returned to India and within a few years became the leader of a
        nationwide struggle for Indian home rule.<br />By <b>1920</b> Gandhi commanded influence hitherto unattained by
        any
        political leader in India.<br />He refashioned the <mark><i><u>Indian National Congress</u></i></mark> into an
        effective political<br/>
        instrument of Indian nationalism and undertook major campaigns of nonviolent resistance in <b>1920–22,
            1930–34</b><br/>
        <strong>(including his momentous march to the sea to collect salt to protest a government monopoly)</strong>,
        and <b>1940–42.</b> In the<br/>
        1930s he also campaigned to end discrimination against India’s lower-caste
        “<mark><i><u>untouchables</u></mark></i>”
        <strong>(Dalits;<br/>
            officially
            designated as Scheduled Castes)</strong> and concentrated on educating rural India and promoting cottage
        industry.<br /><b><i>India</i></b>
        achieved dominion status in <b>1947,</b> but the partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan was a
        great<br/>
        disappointment to Gandhi, who had long worked for Hindu-Muslim unity.<br /> In September 1947 he ended rioting
        in
        Calcutta<br/> <strong>(<px>Kolkata</px>)</strong> by fasting.<br /> Known as the Mahatma
        <strong>(“Great-Souled”),</strong>
        Gandhi <br/>had won the affection and loyalty
        of millions. In January <b>1948</b> he was shot and killed by a young Hindu fanatic.<br />
