        Nagpur is a large city in the central Indian state of Maharashtra. The 19th-century Nagpur Central Museum
        displays items found locally, including fossils, sarcophagi and Mughal weaponry. The Raman Science Centre has
        hands-on exhibits and a planetarium. Sitabuldi Fort, in the Sitabuldi Hills, was the site of an 1817 battle. To
        the southwest, the immense, domed Deekshabhoomi is a Buddhist monument and pilgrimage site.
