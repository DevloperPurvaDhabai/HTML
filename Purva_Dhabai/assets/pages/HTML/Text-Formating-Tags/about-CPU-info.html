        <h1>CPU Information</h1>
        <h3>Definition of CPU</h3>
        <P>
            The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the "brain" of a computer, responsible for executing instructions from
            software and controlling other components. It's a fundamental piece of hardware in all computing devices,
            from PCs to smartphones. The CPU processes data, performs calculations, and manages the flow of information
            within the system.

        <h2>CPU Components</h2>
        <p>1. Primary memory</p>
        <p>2. Secondary memory</p>
        <p>3. Processor</p>
        <p>4. Motherboard</p>
        <p>5. Power supply</p>
        <p>6. Cooling system</p>
        <p>7. GPU (graphics processing unit)</p>

        <h2>What is primary memory</h2>
        <p>Primary memory, also known as main memory or RAM, is a computer's internal memory that the CPU can directly
            access.<br /> It's used to store data and instructions that the computer is actively using, enabling quick
            access
            and processing. Primary memory is volatile, meaning its contents are lost when the power is turned off.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Secondary Memory</h2>
        <p>Secondary memory, also known as auxiliary or external memory, is a type of non-volatile computer memory that
            is not directly accessed by the CPU. It provides long-term data storage for files, applications, and the
            operating system. Unlike primary memory (RAM),<br /> which is volatile and loses data when powered off,
            secondary
            memory retains information even when the computer is turned off. </p>

        <h2>What is Processor</h2>
        <p>A computer processor, also known as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), is the "brain" of the computer,
            responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. <br/>It interprets and executes commands from
            software, controlling all other components and enabling the computer to perform tasks. Think of it as the
            conductor of an orchestra, ensuring all parts of the computer work together efficiently.
